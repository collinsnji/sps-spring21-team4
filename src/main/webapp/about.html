                        <a href="/">Poetry Critic</a> is a project aimed at deciphering poetry from a community
                        perspective. For the longest time, Poetry has been considered a genre of literature reserved for
                        the elite. But as one of my favourite poets puts it,
                    <blockquote>Poetry is not a luxury. &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde"
                            target="_blank">Audre Lorde</a></blockquote>
                    Poetry is a sub genre of English Literature that is very fascinating, and often very confusing
                    for students and even professional writers educators. Because poetry often follow various strict
                    writing rules that limits the length of poems, understanding the poet's intent and true
                    meaning behind the poem can be a hassle. Current tools and websites available today (LitCharts,
                    Sparknotes et. al) are great resources to get a brief overview of any text. But what these tools
                    don't offer is a <em>community focused</em> approach to learning poetry, and that is where Poetry
                    Critic fills in the gap. <em>Poetry Critic allows anyone to annotate lines of a poem adding
                        knowledge to a line that may be otherwise complex to analyze</em>

                <div class="about-section-text">
                    <p class="section-text">
                        Poetry Critic use Google Datastore for storing poem data as well as the annotations. To add an
                        annotation, simply click on a line. An annotation text area will open up where you can add an
                        annotation. You must be logged in to add an annotation. The log in process uses Google OAuth2.0,
                        and the implementation for this project is heavily based on <a
                            href="https://happycoding.io/tutorials/google-cloud/oauth-2" target="_blank">Kevin Workman's
                            tutorial on Google OAuth.</a>
                        Lastly, this project uses Google Text to Speech API for the text to speech engine responsible
                        for reading the poems out loud.

                <h2 class="about-section-title">Challenges and Wins</h2>
                <div class="about-section-text">
                    <p class="section-text">
                        My biggest challenge in this whole process was getting up to speed with Datastore. Datastore
                        offers a great API. However, the documentation is very lacking in very specific areas,
                        especially for new beginners or someone looking for a very quick implementation. It took me a
                        while to understand how to navigate the various endpoints and APIs, but when I finally did, it
                        was smooth sailing from there on out. Another challenge I ran into was CORS error when
                        redirecting in the authentication step. I resolved this issue by letting JS handle the redirect.
                        This is certainly not the most efficient way of resolving the issue, but for the time being, it
                        was the best solution I could think of. But will all these challenges, there were big wins that
                        came out of the project. First, I worked on the project alone due to some technical difficulties
                        with my team, but I was still able to finish the project as envisioned. Second, through this
                        process, I learned how to use CSS grids as well as typography for styling. Finally, just
                        completing the project itself was a huge win for me, and one that I am truly proud of.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        While I got most of the initial ground work done, there is still significant room for
                        improvements in the project.
                    <ul>
                        <li>- The authentication doesn't quite works as intended</li>
                        <li>- The UX could use some major improvements</li>
                        <li>- An upvote/downvote system on the annotations will be nice</li>
                        <li>- Adding the ability to add comments on the poems or annotations will also be nice</li>

                        Hello there! My name is Collins Nji (aka Collin) and I built The Poetry Critic. I'm a rising
                        junior at Mount St. Mary's University in Northern Maryland. I'm currently pursuing my undergrad
                        with a major in Computer Science, and a double minor in Data Science and English Language. I am
                        very passionate about literature and language, which was a motivational factor behind Poetry
                        Critic. This spring semester, I enrolled in three English Language courses (it's a bad idea
                        don't try it), and I had to read a lot of different text, including lots of poems. I am terrible
                        at interpreting poems, and often have no clue what the poet is saying. I created the Poetry
                        Critic is because I understand the frustration one can have when they have no clue what a poet
                        is talking about in a poem. Hopefully through our shared love for literature and shared
                        frustration of poetry, the Poetry Critic can offer a way to alleviate this frustration.
